The player controls a snake that crawls along a plane, collecting food (in this case 'apples') avoiding a collision with own tail. Each time the snake eats an apple, it becomes longer, making the game progressively more difficult.

My rules for the game "Snake"
The starting position is one cell (“Apple”), which is located in the central position of the screen.
The snake starts crawling from a random position.
In my version, you cannot die when colliding with a wall, the snake comes out of the opposite wall, when colliding with itself (“self-eating”) the snake returns to the starting position
When eating an "Apple", a new snake cell is added.
